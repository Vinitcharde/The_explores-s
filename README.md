# 🏥 Patient Queue & Triage Optimizer

An **emergency & priority-based patient management system** designed to optimize patient flow in high-load clinics and hospitals.  
The system dynamically prioritizes patients based on severity, waiting time, and staff availability to ensure **critical cases are treated first**.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Emergency and OPD departments often struggle to decide:
- Who should be seen first
- How to manage long queues during rush hours
- How to adapt when staff availability changes  

This results in **delayed treatment for serious patients**, staff burnout, and inefficient use of hospital resources.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We propose a **Smart Triage & Queue Management System** that:
- Automatically prioritizes patients using severity and waiting time
- Dynamically updates queues as conditions change
- Provides a clear dashboard for doctors and staff
- Allows manual overrides when needed

---

## 🧠 Key Features
